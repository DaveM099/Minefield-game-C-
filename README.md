# Minefield game C#
 Themed after the movie 'Finding Nemo', the C# minefield game sets the player as Marlin, the father, situated at the bottom left corner, while Nemo, his son, awaits at the top.  Objective:  Guide Marlin through the perilous waters to reunite with Nemo. However, numerous jellyfish mines obstruct their path, and time is limited, the duration varying with the chosen difficulty level.  Difficulty Levels:  Upon launching, the game defaults to the Moderate difficulty setting. Players can adjust the challenge by selecting from Easy, Moderate, Hard, or Impossible modes. Each difficulty level features a different quantity of jellyfish mines and distinct time constraints.  Gameplay:  Initiate the game by pressing "START" after selecting the desired difficulty level. Navigate Marlin using the arrow keys on either the screen or keyboard. Be cautious not to collide with the jellyfish mines, as doing so halts the game, reveals the mines, displays a corresponding consequence image, and results in failure. Likewise, running out of time ends the game unfavorably.  Victory Conditions:  Successfully guiding Marlin to Nemo results in a win, accompanied by an image of their heartwarming reunion.  Restarting the Game:  If unsuccessful, players can restart by clicking "Try again," which maintains the chosen difficulty level, or by selecting a new level and pressing "Start."  Elapsed Time Tracking:  The game also records the elapsed time of each session.  Controls:  Navigate: Arrow keys (on-screen or keyboard) Reveal Mines: Blue button (or "M" on the keyboard), usable twice per game for a limited duration. Hide Mines: Optional red button (for immediate concealment) Restart: "Space" key on the keyboard or dedicated restart button
